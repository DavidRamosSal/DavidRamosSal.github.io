	<h1>Hi there, I'm David Ramos!</h1>
	<p>I'm interested on theoretical astrophysics. I plan to post some of the things I work on and I'm interested in on this website.
	I'm currently building models of neutron stars using different equations of state and using physical criteria to identify useful models, 
	that will later be used in models of stellar collapse on general relativity.</p>
