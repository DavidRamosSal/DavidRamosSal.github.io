	<h1>Hi there, I'm David Ramos!</h1>
	<p>I'm interested on high energy physics and theoretical astrophysics. I plan to post some of the things I work on and I'm interested in on this website.
	My last work was on building models of neutron stars using different equations of state and using physical criteria to identify useful models, 
	which will be used later in models of stellar collapse on general relativity.</p>
